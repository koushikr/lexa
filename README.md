> Science is the systematic classification of experience

> Nomenclature, the other foundation of botany, should provide the names as soon as the classification is made… If the names are unknown knowledge of the things also perishes… For a single genus, a single name.

Lexa is a quick, easy to use CMS written atop [jElastic](https://github.com/koushikr/jelastic)

### Tech

Lexa uses a number of open source projects to work:

* [Dropwizard](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard) - To float the application!
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) - Data store that is used.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host.
